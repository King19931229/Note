1.num=10(delcare a var,note that space is not allowed on both = side.)
2.declare -r NUM=10(declare a const, note that space is not allowed on both = side.)
3.num=$((num+10)) ($((exp)) exp calcuation need two( and one $, you can put space between ().)
4.let num=num+10(or let num+=10) (another way to do math calcuation use keyword let.)
5.num=$((num++)) num=$((++num)) (self increment or self decrement.)
6.
a=10.5
b=3.3
c=$(python -c "print $a+$b")
echo $c
(use python to do float calcuation a hack way.)
7.
cat<<MSG
This is a short message.
MSG
(print a message to the console)
[function]
1.declare and use a function
getDate()
{
        date
        return
}
getDate
output: 2019年 05月 04日 星期六 16:36:00 CST
2.delcare local var
name=king
testfunc()
{
        local name=yang
        return
}
testfunc
echo $name
output: king
3.pass var into a function
sumfunc()
{
        local v1=$1
        local v2=$2
        local sum=$((v1+v2))
        echo $sum
}
sumfunc 10 20
sum=$(sumfunc 10 20)
echo sum of 10 and 20 is $sum
output:
30
sum of 10 and 20 is 30
(first 30 produced by direct call, the second one collect the res into sum then use echo to output it)
[condition]
1.receive input
read -p "what is your name " name
echo $name
2.condition branch
read -p "what is your age " age
echo your age is $age
if [ $age -eq 18 ]
then
	echo you are just adult
elif [ $age -lt 18 ]
then
        echo you are not adult
else
        echo you are more than adult
fi
(note that 'then' can't be right after ']' unless you put a ';' after that ']'
and space must be contained between '[' and ']' also
'fi' must occur to indicate close of the condition branch)

another approch:
if [ $age -eq 18 ]; then echo you are just adult
elif [ $age -lt 18 ]; then echo you are not adult
else echo you are more than adult

you can put two '(' to a compartion with using '$' and '['
third approch:
if ((age==18)); then echo you are just adult
elif ((age<18)); then echo you are not adult
else echo you are more than adult
fi

one more example:
if (( (($age%2))==0 )); then echo your age is even
#if [ $(($age%2)) -eq 0 ]; then echo your age is even
else echo your age is odd
fi
